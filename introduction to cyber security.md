# introduction to cybersecurity
Cyber security focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorised access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible. Information security is a broader category that protects all information assets, whether in hard copy or digital form.Some of the attacks are:
## MALWARE
Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.
## PHISHING
Phishing works by sending messages that look like they are from a legitimate company or website. Phishing messages will usually contain a link that takes the user to a fake website that looks like the real thing. The user is then asked to enter personal information, such as their credit card number.
## MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK
A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of eavesdropping attack, where attackers interrupt an existing conversation or data transfer. After inserting themselves in the "middle" of the transfer, the attackers pretend to be both legitimate participants.
(hacker by using ip of any user can intercept the server and user pc and get some important data)
## DDOS
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a category of malicious cyber-attacks that hackers or cybercriminals employ in order to make an online service, network resource or host machine unavailable to its intended users on the Internet
#### DDOS attacks mainly works on botnet.
#### Botnet may be any device.
#### Hacker remotely use other devices to make requests and when these request bbecome greater than bandwidth then website crashes
## PASSWORD ATTACK
A password attack refers to any of the various methods used to maliciously authenticate into password-protected accounts. These attacks are typically facilitated through the use of software that expedites cracking or guessing passwords.
## PREVENTING PASSWORD ATTACKS:
#### Multi-factor authentication.Using a physical token (like a Yubikey) or a personal device (like a mobile phone) to authenticate users ensures that passwords are not the sole gate to access.
#### Remote access. Using a smart remote access platform like OneLogin means that individual websites are no longer the source of user trust. Instead, OneLogin ensures that the user's identity is confirmed, then logs them in.
#### Biometrics. A malicious actor will find it very difficult to replicate your fingerprint or facial shape. Enabling biometric authentication turns your password into only one of several points of trust that a hacker needs to overcome.
## SQL INJECTION
SQL injection (SQLi) is a cyberattack that injects malicious SQL code into an application, allowing the attacker to view or modify a database
First, there is a software defect
#### • That defect results in a security vulnerability (or just vulnerability)
#### • A vulnerability is a weakness for certain types of attacks on the security of the application
#### • One of the possible attack types is an SQL Injection
#### • So, if you have a vulnerability that permits SQL Injection attacks, you have an SQL Injection vulnerability
#### • Why are we talking about this before we know more about security?
## COMPONENTS:
The scope of SQL includes
#### data query
#### data manipulation (insert, update, and delete),
#### data definition (schema creation and modification), 
### data access control.
# CIA triad
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three letters upon which CIA triad stands. The CIA Triad is a common prototype that constructs the basis for the development of security systems. They are used to find vulnerabilities and methods to create solutions
**C stands for confidentiality**
**I stand for integrity**
**A stands for Availabilty**
The CIA model describes the three important goals of cybersecurity.
## CONFIDENTIALITY
The C stands for
confidentiality. Cybersecurity requires privacy in data and information. Certain people, devices,
or processes should be permitted or restricted from seeing data, files, and items, like username,
password combinations, medical records, etc. Confidentiality is concerned with viewing of data
or information because if the wrong people see data or information they are not authorized,
many problems could arise.
## INTEGRITY:
The I in the CIA model stands for integrity. Cybersecurity requires us to feel safe that data
transmitted, processed, and stored has not been changed from its original form either
accidentally or maliciously. For example, if one bit of a message is change, the whole message
could change. Also, the whole message could be corrupted or unreadable.
## AVAILABILITY:
For the last letter A, it stands for availability. Availability guarantees that with all the
cybersecurity measures in place for dealing with hardware, software, people, processes and
more, users who are authorized to do their job should be able to do so. It requires that authorized
users should be able to access the resources they need to do their job with easy while ensuring
that the system have full tolerance and load balancing in the event of cybersecurity incident or
disaster.
# NIST FRAMEWORKS
**NIST**
is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps businesses of all sizes better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data.
### why we need framework for cybersecyrity?
It helps the organization to manage,understand and reduce cybersecurity risks.
### Why do I need NIST?
The main function of NIST is to create best practices (also known as standards) for organizations and government agencies to follow. These security standards are developed to improve the security posture of government agencies and private companies dealing with government data
### types of framework:
#### 1.PCIDDS:
stands for payment card industry data security standard. **it is designed to secure credit cards,debit cards and cash card transaction.**
#### 2.ISO 2700
international organization of standardization. **it is designed to managing and secure information security management system.**
#### 3.CIS
CIS benchmarks are internationally recognized as security standards for defending IT systems and data against cyberattacks. Used by thousands of businesses, they offer prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure baseline configuration.
#### 4.NIST
it is most popular frame work used now a days.NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF standard and technology.
**it is designed to make organization secure.These organization may be include national security centers,economic organizations.
