# introduction to cybersecurity
Cyber security focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorised access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible. Information security is a broader category that protects all information assets, whether in hard copy or digital form.Some of the attacks are:
## MALWARE
Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.
## PHISHING
Phishing works by sending messages that look like they are from a legitimate company or website. Phishing messages will usually contain a link that takes the user to a fake website that looks like the real thing. The user is then asked to enter personal information, such as their credit card number.
## MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK
A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of eavesdropping attack, where attackers interrupt an existing conversation or data transfer. After inserting themselves in the "middle" of the transfer, the attackers pretend to be both legitimate participants.
(hacker by using ip of any user can intercept the server and user pc and get some important data)
## DDOS
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a category of malicious cyber-attacks that hackers or cybercriminals employ in order to make an online service, network resource or host machine unavailable to its intended users on the Internet
## PASSWORD ATTACK
A password attack refers to any of the various methods used to maliciously authenticate into password-protected accounts. These attacks are typically facilitated through the use of software that expedites cracking or guessing passwords.
## SQL INJECTION
SQL injection (SQLi) is a cyberattack that injects malicious SQL code into an application, allowing the attacker to view or modify a database
# CIA triad
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three letters upon which CIA triad stands. The CIA Triad is a common prototype that constructs the basis for the development of security systems. They are used to find vulnerabilities and methods to create solutions
**C stands for confidentiality**
**I stand for integrity**
**A stands for Availabilty**
