# introduction to cybersecurity
Cyber security focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorised access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible. Information security is a broader category that protects all information assets, whether in hard copy or digital form.Some of the attacks are:
## MALWARE
Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.
## PHISHING
Phishing works by sending messages that look like they are from a legitimate company or website. Phishing messages will usually contain a link that takes the user to a fake website that looks like the real thing. The user is then asked to enter personal information, such as their credit card number.
## MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK
A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of eavesdropping attack, where attackers interrupt an existing conversation or data transfer. After inserting themselves in the "middle" of the transfer, the attackers pretend to be both legitimate participants.
(hacker by using ip of any user can intercept the server and user pc and get some important data)
## DDOS
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a category of malicious cyber-attacks that hackers or cybercriminals employ in order to make an online service, network resource or host machine unavailable to its intended users on the Internet
## PASSWORD ATTACK
A password attack refers to any of the various methods used to maliciously authenticate into password-protected accounts. These attacks are typically facilitated through the use of software that expedites cracking or guessing passwords.
## SQL INJECTION
SQL injection (SQLi) is a cyberattack that injects malicious SQL code into an application, allowing the attacker to view or modify a database
# CIA triad
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three letters upon which CIA triad stands. The CIA Triad is a common prototype that constructs the basis for the development of security systems. They are used to find vulnerabilities and methods to create solutions
**C stands for confidentiality**
**I stand for integrity**
**A stands for Availabilty**
# NIST FRAMEWORKS
**NIST**
is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps businesses of all sizes better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data.
### why we need framework for cybersecyrity?
It helps the organization to manage,understand and reduce cybersecurity risks.
### Why do I need NIST?
The main function of NIST is to create best practices (also known as standards) for organizations and government agencies to follow. These security standards are developed to improve the security posture of government agencies and private companies dealing with government data
### types of framework:
#### 1.PCIDDS:
stands for payment card industry data security standard. **it is designed to secure credit cards,debit cards and cash card transaction.**
#### 2.ISO 2700
international organization of standardization. **it is designed to managing and secure information security management system.**
#### 3.CIS
CIS benchmarks are internationally recognized as security standards for defending IT systems and data against cyberattacks. Used by thousands of businesses, they offer prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure baseline configuration.
#### 4.NIST
it is most popular frame work used now a days.NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF standard and technology.
**it is designed to make organization secure.These organization may be include national security centers,economic organizations.
